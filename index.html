    <h2>History of Uranium</h2>
    <p>
        Uranium was first identified in 1789 by the German chemist Martin Heinrich 
        Klaproth, who named it after the newly discovered planet Uranus. 
        In the 1800s, uranium compounds were used mainly to color glass 
        and ceramics, producing vibrant yellow-green hues.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted a mysterious 
        form of energy—radioactivity. This discovery later inspired the work of 
        Marie and Pierre Curie, launching the scientific exploration of radioactive 
        elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the 1940s, uranium became central to the development of nuclear physics 
        and early atomic research. It played a crucial role in both scientific 
        advancements and global politics of the mid-20th century. Today, uranium is 
        primarily associated with civilian nuclear energy production and scientific 
        study.

    <h2>Types of Uranium (Isotopes)</h2>
    <p>Uranium occurs naturally in several isotopic forms. Here are the major ones:</p>

    <h3>Uranium-238</h3>
    <p>
        - Makes up about 99% of natural uranium.<br>
        - Very long-lived and only weakly radioactive.<br>
        - Used in scientific research and, in some cases, as depleted uranium for 
          shielding or industrial applications.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Uranium-235</h3>
    <p>
        - About 0.7% of natural uranium.<br>
        - Known for being “fissile,” meaning it can sustain a nuclear chain reaction.<br>
        - Important for nuclear power reactors.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Uranium-234</h3>
    <p>
        - Makes up a tiny fraction (less than 1%) of natural uranium.<br>
        - Appears as part of the natural decay chain of U-238.<br>
        - More radioactive than U-238 but found only in very small amounts.<br>
    </p>

    <p class="note">
        These descriptions are general and non-technical. This site does not provide 
        any guidance on processing or altering uranium, which is strictly regulated.
    </p>

    <h2>Dangers of Uranium</h2>
    <p>
        Uranium poses two kinds of risks: <strong>chemical toxicity</strong> and 
        <strong>radiation exposure</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Chemical Toxicity</h3>
    <p>
        Uranium is a heavy metal, similar to lead. In large, concentrated amounts,
        it can harm the kidneys if ingested or inhaled as dust.
    </p>

    <h3>Radiation Exposure</h3>
    <p>
        Natural uranium is only mildly radioactive. Everyday background exposure from
        soil is usually harmless. Risks arise when:
        <ul>
            <li>Uranium dust is inhaled</li>
            <li>Large quantities are handled without protection</li>
            <li>Exposure occurs in industrial or mining settings</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="note">
        Handling concentrated uranium requires training, licensing, and protective 
        equipment. This website does not provide instructions for use or handling.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="contact" class="panel">
    <h2>If You Encounter Uranium</h2>
    <p>
        If you ever suspect you have come into contact with uranium or a uranium-containing 
        mineral (common in some rock formations), follow these safe, non-technical steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid touching or inhaling dust.</li>
        <li>Wash hands and clothing with soap and water if you made contact.</li>
        <li>Do not attempt to clean up or store unusual radioactive materials.</li>
        <li>Contact local environmental or health authorities if you find suspicious minerals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These are basic safety steps—not instructions for handling uranium. Leave all  
        analysis to professionals.
    </p>

<section id="value" class="panel">
    <h2>Legal Status & “Value” of Uranium</h2>
    <p>
        Uranium is <strong>not a consumer commodity</strong>. It is illegal to sell, 
        purchase, or possess refined uranium without government authorization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prices for uranium that appear in news or markets refer to regulated, 
        industrial-grade uranium used by licensed power plants and agencies—not anything 
        accessible to private individuals.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        If you ever find a uranium-bearing mineral, its legal and monetary value depends 
        only on its value as a *collectible rock specimen*, not as uranium metal.
